# Tic-Tac-Toe---Game
This project is a simple yet engaging web-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
The web-based game features a clean and visually appealing user interface. The game allows two players to take turns marking the spaces on a 3x3 grid with their respective symbols (X or O). The objective is to achieve a winning pattern before the opponent.
Key Features:

2.Stylish UI: The use of vibrant colors, carefully chosen fonts, and box shadows enhances the overall aesthetics of the game.
3.Turn Indicator: A dynamic turn indicator displays whose turn it is, with X and O alternately highlighted.
4.Reset and New Game Buttons: Users can reset the game at any point or start a new game after a win. The buttons are styled for easy interaction.
5.Winning Animation: When a player wins, a visually appealing winning message is displayed, and the winning combination is highlighted.
6.GitHub Repository:
